     Wonder woman
</h6>
<p>
    Wonder Woman granted by Demeter (Goddess of the Earth). Diana is literally as strong 
    as the Earth because of her link to the planet granted to her by Demeter. She is said to be 
    'stronger than Hercules'. It is obvious her strength is magical in nature, given her height 
    and weight. She has superior strength, speed,and agility.She can fly and is trained in hand-to-hand
    combat.She also had the ability to talk to animals.
