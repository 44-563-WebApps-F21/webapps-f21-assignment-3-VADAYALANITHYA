<h1> Food I love and recommend for someone</h1>
<p>
    I am going to create a table with my four favourite items and i try to recommend someone to eat them.
    they are Butter Naan, Vegetable Pulav, Butter Chicken and Gulab jamun.
    </p>
    

    <table>
        <table border="1">

<h1> Negative cycle in a graph</h1>
<blockquote>
Below is an algorithm to find if there is a negative weight cycle reachable from the given source.
Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself
as 0. Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is
the source vertex. This step calculates the shortest distances. Do the following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in the given graph. 
Do the following for each edge u-v. If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v].
